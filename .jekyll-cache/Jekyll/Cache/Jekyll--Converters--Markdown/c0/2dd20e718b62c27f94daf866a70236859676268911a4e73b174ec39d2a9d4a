I"€<p>Reading got me into books and books got me into design and illustration. In a way, theyâ€™re the reason I became a graphic designer.</p>

<p>Backstory</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been collecting old books and printed ephemera for a bunch of years. My favorite spot to look for books is Feira da Ladra, the biggest and oldest flea market in Lisbon. When I was in college, more often than not Iâ€™d skip Tuesday morningâ€™s classes to go there. I loved that ritual so much. It was always a thrill: exploring the city and the infinite archives of old shit that all those people would bring together in a single place. Iâ€™d sometimes take the subway to Santa ApolÃ³nia and start at the bottom of the feira; sometimes I walked or hopped on the 28 tram to Voz do OperÃ¡rio, crossing Alfama, and started at the top, next to SÃ£o Vicente de Fora. Sometimes Iâ€™d go with friends but almost always by myself.</p>
